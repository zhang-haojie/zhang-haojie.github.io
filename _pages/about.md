<span class="anchor" id="about-me"></span>

I am currently a Master at [South China University of Techonology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Kui Jia](http://kuijia.site/). I received my bachelor degree from the same university (i.e. SCUT) in 2023, and expect to obtain my Master degree in 2026. 

I mainly focus on **Computer Vision**. My current research interests include Semantic Perception and Domain Adaptation. Recently, I am working on Domain Adaptation.
