<span class="anchor" id="about-me"></span>

I am currently a Master at [South China University of Techonology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Kui Jia](http://kuijia.site/). I received my bachelor degree from the same university (i.e. SCUT) in 2023, and expect to obtain my Master degree in 2026. 

I mainly focus on **Computer Vision**. My current research interests include Semantic Perception and Domain Adaptation. Recently, I am working on Domain Adaptation.

[Improving the Generalization of Segmentation Foundation Model under Distribution Shift via Weakly Supervised Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03502)

 **Haojie Zhang\***, Yongyi Su\*, Xun Xu‚úù, Kui Jia

[**Project**](https://zhang-haojie.github.io/project-pages/wesam.html) | [**Code**](https://github.com/zhang-haojie/wesam)

- We propose a task-agnostic solution to adapt the SAM model for diverse downstream segmentation tasks using self-training without access to the source dataset. By leveraging weak supervisions such as bounding boxes, point-wise annotations, and coarse segmentation masks, we enhance the adaptation effectiveness, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on 5 types of downstream instance segmentation tasks.
